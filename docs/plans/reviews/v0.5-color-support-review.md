# v0.5.0 Color Support Review

Assessment

The implementation matches the plan for per-cell ANSI color support. The new `canvas/color.go` type and ANSI helpers are in place, `canvas.Canvas` now allocates an optional color grid, `SetColor` stores last-write-wins cell colors, and `Frame()` emits color escape codes with per-cell resets plus a no-color fast path. Tests cover the listed behaviors with visual flag support, and the demo program is updated to v0.5.0 with color demos 21-24 and the required `math` import.

Issues to Address

1. The v0.5.0 deliverables checklist in `docs/plans/PLAN.md` is still unchecked despite the work being present.

Suggested Next Steps

1. Update `docs/plans/PLAN.md` to mark the v0.5.0 deliverables complete.
2. Run `go test ./...` and `go test ./canvas/... -v -args -visual` to confirm unit and visual outputs.
3. Run `go run ./examples/demo/` and visually inspect demos 21-24 for color output.
