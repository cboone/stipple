# v0.4.0 Circle Drawing Review

Assessment

The implementation delivers circle outline and filled drawing using the midpoint algorithm with 8-way symmetry and span filling. Tests cover symmetry, radius 0, radius 1, negative radius, float coordinates, off-canvas clipping, filled interiors, gap scanning, and outline-only behavior. The demo updates align with the plan, including the v0.4.0 banner and demos 16-20.

Issues to Address

1. Golden snapshot coverage is missing. The plan calls for ASCII frame snapshots in `draw/testdata/` with comparisons to `c.Frame()` and an update flag workflow. Current tests only use `printVisual` without golden files.

Suggested Next Steps

1. Add golden snapshot files in `draw/testdata/` for a few small circles and wire the tests to compare `c.Frame()` with the snapshots, including the update flag path.
2. Run `go test ./...` and `go test ./draw/... -v -args -visual` to confirm the new snapshot expectations and visual outputs.
