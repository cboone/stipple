# v0.3.0 Rectangle Drawing Review

Assessment

The commit delivers the rectangle outline and filled implementations as planned, with tests covering standard, zero-size, off-canvas, small, and float coordinate cases. The demo updates align with the new functionality and the v0.3.0 banner. Overall, the core behaviors match the plan and should provide the expected drawing output for Maze Wars walls.

Issues to Address

None. The implementation matches the plan:

1. ~~Visual flag helper is not defined in `draw/rectangle_test.go`~~ - Resolved: The plan explicitly states at line 104 that "Tests use shared helpers from `draw/test_helpers_test.go`", and the implementation correctly created this file with shared `visualFlag`, `TestMain`, and `printVisual` definitions.

2. ~~Demo numbering and insertion point differ from the plan~~ - Resolved: The plan at line 163 explicitly states to insert after `"11. Star pattern (multiple lines):"` with demo numbers 12-15, which matches the implementation exactly.
