# v0.3.0 Rectangle Drawing Review

Assessment

The commit delivers the rectangle outline and filled implementations as planned, with tests covering standard, zero-size, off-canvas, small, and float coordinate cases. The demo updates align with the new functionality and the v0.3.0 banner. Overall, the core behaviors match the plan and should provide the expected drawing output for Maze Wars walls.

Issues to Address

1. Visual flag helper is not defined in `draw/rectangle_test.go` as the plan specifies.
   - Impact: The rectangle tests depend on `printVisual` and `TestMain` living in `draw/line_test.go`, which is an implicit coupling and can break if the line tests are refactored or removed.
   - Fix: Move `visualFlag`, `TestMain`, and `printVisual` into a shared helper like `draw/test_helpers_test.go`, and remove the duplicate definitions from `draw/line_test.go` so all draw tests share the same entry point.

2. Demo numbering and insertion point differ from the plan.
   - Impact: The plan says to insert after the label `"8. Star pattern:"` with demo numbers 9-12, but the code inserts after `"11. Star pattern (multiple lines):"` and uses demo numbers 12-15. This is a plan mismatch that can confuse verification steps.
   - Fix: Update `docs/plans/v0.3-rectangle-drawing.md` to reflect the current demo numbering and label, or renumber the demo section in `examples/demo/main.go` to match the plan.
